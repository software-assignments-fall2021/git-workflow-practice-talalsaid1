I chose this article as we have seen in recent years how advancements in technology may effect certain jobs and people, but it is the first time where I see a real ‘threat’ to software developers. It is interesting to see the results of this new artificial intelligence technology, but I also think it will wipe out many job opportunities if it is to be used in the future instead of coders. Yet, the program still makes mistakes and does not reason like a human so therefore it is not a complete substitute. It is interesting to see that “you still need a skilled human to review the output”. This is comforting for young coders like us.  Smith also says that it can boost human productivity. After reading this article I became more interested in AI.

This is also my first time hearing of Codex. It seems like a wonderful tool to have. It's amazing that you can tell it to create animations like snowfall and it will just do it. I could never. Thankfully, our jobs are still secure. But imagine if an AI is created that can actually learn and think on its feet!
